Face Authentication using Face Liveness Detection

Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop a lightweight and efficient system for real-time face liveness detection and user recognition using a webcam. It focuses on detecting liveness to prevent spoofing attempts such as using photos, videos, or masks.

Objectives:
1) To develop a Real-Time Face Liveness Detection System.
2) To enhance Security by Preventing Spoofing Attempts
3) To enable Seamless User Recognition and Registration
